### Description

**(Write a brief and engaging description of your project here. What does 
it do? What problem does it solve?)** 

For example:

This project is a Python script that decrypts messages encrypted with a 
simple Caesar cipher. It's designed to be easy to use and understand, 
making it perfect for educational purposes or anyone who wants to learn 
about basic cryptography.

### Decryption

**(Explain how the decryption process works. Be clear and concise. You can 
use pseudocode or diagrams to illustrate.)**

For example:

The script uses a brute-force approach to decrypt the message. It iterates 
through each possible shift value (from 1 to 25) and attempts to decipher 
the encrypted text. The shift value is the number of positions each letter 
in the plaintext is shifted by in the cipher. The decrypted message with 
the highest frequency of common letters is chosen as the correct 
decryption.

### Usage

**(Provide step-by-step instructions on how to use your project.)**

For example:

1. **Install Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. **Clone the repository:** `git clone 
https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git`
3. **Run the script:** 
   ```bash
   python decryptor.py 
   ```

4. **Enter the encrypted message:** You will be prompted to enter the 
encrypted message.
5. **View the decrypted message:** The script will output the decrypted 
message to the console.
